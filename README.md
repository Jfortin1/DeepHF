### System requirements
The code were tesed on Linux and Mac OS systems.
The required software/packages are:
* python=3.6.5
* numpy=1.14.0 
* scipy=1.0.0 
* h5py=2.7.1 
* tensorflow=1.8.0 
* keras=2.1.6 
* scikit-learn=0.19.1 
* biopython=1.71 
* viennarna=2.4.5
Installation time depends on your own network environment.

It is worth noting that when the computing environment(e.g, the version of tensorflow or biopython) changes, the prediction results might change slightly, but the main conclusion won't be affected.

### Installation Guide
```bash
conda create -n crispr python=3.6.5 ipykernel numpy=1.14.0 scipy=1.0.0 h5py=2.7.1 tensorflow=1.8.0 keras=2.1.6 scikit-learn=0.19.1 biopython=1.71 viennarna=2.4.5
ipython kernel install --user --name crispr --display-name "Python3(crispr)"
```
### Demo
Demos were included in the  [Demo.ipynb](https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF/blob/master/Demo.ipynb) file. It contains prediction, metrics and model training demos.

### Files description
* [feature_util.py](https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF/blob/master/feature_util.py) contains the code for extracting position related features and biological features.

* [prediction_util.py](https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF/blob/master/prediction_util.py) contains the core code of prediction module for the website [www.DeepHF.com](http://www.deephf.com).

* [training_util.py](https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF/blob/master/training_util.py) provides the code for training model in your own computing environment. The optimized hyperparameters is only fit for the aformentioned software/package environment.

* [data/esp_seq_data_array.pkl](https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF/blob/master/data/esp_seq_data_array.pkl), features and experimental edit efficiency data for eSpCas9(1.1). It can be used to train the model.

* [data/hf_seq_data_array.pkl](https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF/blob/master/data/hf_seq_data_array.pkl) , features and experimental edit efficiency data for Cas9-HF1. It can be used to train the model.

* [models/esp_rnn_model.hd5](https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF/blob/master/models/esp_rnn_model.hd5),the final model file of eSpCas9(1.1) used in the DeepHF wibsite.
